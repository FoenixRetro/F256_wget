WGET for the Foenix F256.

This is a simple wget implementation for the Foenix F256.

Usage:  wget url [filename]

The filename is optional.  If omitted, wget will attempt to parse
a filename out of the URL.  If the URL doesn't include a filename,
'index.html' will be used.

The filename may include a path specification, so if you have a
"downloads" directory on your SDCard, you can use "downloads/foo.bar"
for a filename.

wget will NOT download to an IEC device ... the bus is just too slow.

This is a *simple* wget.  It does not support TLS connections, chunked
downloads, non-200 responses, [ip] hostnames, or non-standard ports.
Support for all but the TLS feature could be easily added, but this
is the state of 1.0 :).
