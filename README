WGET for the Foenix F256.

This is a simple wget implementation for the Foenix F256.

Usage:  wget path [filename]

The path may be either a url or the name of a file on the SD card
followed by a path, eg "myserver/foo.bin".  In this second case,
wget will attempt to use the first line found in the file as a
prefix.  For example, if myserver contained "http://192.168.1.1",
then the effective url would be "http://192.168.1.1/foo.bin".

The filename is optional. If omitted, wget will attempt to parse a
filename out of the URL. If the URL doesn't include a filename,
'index.html' will be used.

The filename may include a path specification, so if you have a
"downloads" directory on your SDCard, you can use "downloads/foo.bar"
for a filename.

wget will NOT download to an IEC device ... the bus is just too slow.

This is a relatively simple wget. It does not support TLS connections,
chunked downloads, and most non-200 responses. Port redirects and "301
Moved Permanently" responses are supported, but note that many sites
now refuse non-TLS requests, and some sites are even refusing
connections from TCP/IP stacks which don't support contemporary
congestion control.
